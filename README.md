# Intershala-project
A small authentication project
This website has security to protect user password by using "HASHING AND SALTING". It means it's allmost going to be impossible for hackers to hijeck the password of all users. This encryption handled by "Encypyt" Algorithm. Here,we used different file for handled registration and login page also. But the most thing that, by using saling and hashing in 2020 a hacker not hijack our user's password. As soon as yaer's go ,we increase our salting power. But keep in mind that, more the number of salting more the time for execution of a CPU.
